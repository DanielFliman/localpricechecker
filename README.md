This code is a Python script that scrapes inventory information for a given SKU (stock keeping unit) from various stores such as Walmart, Lowes, and Home-Depot within a certain radius of a given zip code.

The code uses the following libraries:
* csv: provides functionality to read and write CSV files.
* re: provides regular expression operations to search and manipulate text.
* pprint: provides a pretty-printing functionality to print data structures in a readable format.
* pyzipcode: provides access to a database of zip codes in the United States and their coordinates.

* BrickseekScraper: a custom module that scrapes inventory information from Brickseek, a website that aggregates product availability data from various stores.

The code first prompts the user to choose between decoding Walmart URLs to extract SKUs or directly entering the SKUs. If the former option is chosen, the user can enter multiple Walmart URLs, and the script will extract the SKUs from them using a regular expression. Otherwise, the user can directly enter the SKUs separated by spaces.

The code then prompts the user to select a store from a list of available stores and to enter a source zip code and a radius. It uses the ZipCodeDatabase library to generate a list of zip codes within the requested radius of the source zip code.

For each SKU, the code loops through the selected stores and scrapes inventory information using the BrickseekScraper module. If inventory information is found for a store, the script prints the results, including the cheapest price and location, and saves them as a CSV file. If no results are found for a SKU, the script prints a message indicating that no results were found.
